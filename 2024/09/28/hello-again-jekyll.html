<p>I was looking into rebuilding a personal site and was bouncing back and forth between a few options.
I wanted something simple, and what could be simpler than straight HTML, CSS, and Javascript?
As those are all static files, deploying would be as simple as uploading it to a web server.
Choosing Github pages, the cost of operating that is basically free.
This seemed like a place to start, until I thought it would be nice to share and discuss code snippets.
This makes it difficult without some tool support.
This brought me back to Jekyll.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a static site generator that comes with some useful features, including rendering blocks of syntax highlighted code.</p>
